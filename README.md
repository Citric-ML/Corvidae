Corvidae is a Github Pages-based webapp, serving as a tool for collecting, connecting, and synthesizing knowledge from Wikipedia. 
Unlike other knowledge-synthesis webapps, Corvidae is more than just an LLM plugin, in fact it uses no LLM technology. 
Rather, it parses information and presents it to the user in it's rawest form, allowing them to make their own connections and build knowledge for themsleves.
